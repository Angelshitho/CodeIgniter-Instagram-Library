CodeIgniter library to interact with the Instagram API

Clone the git repository and copy the files to your CodeIgniter application. The library uses Jamie Rumbelow's MY_input.php class to allow ? in CodeIgniter URLs. For more information visit http://www.jamierumbelow.net and see the MY_Input.php file included in application/libraries

You will need to set up a new client with Instagram at http://instagram.com/developer/

Once this is complete copy the details supplied by Instagram into application/config/Instagram_api_lang.php

To use the library add $this->load->library('instagram_api'); to any class or function in your desired controller.

All Instagram API functions, apart from getPopularMedia(), require an access token which Instagram supplies through OAuth.

To set the access token in the Instagram API class use

$this->instagram_api->access_token = YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN;

after you have loaded the library.

Sample of the functions can be seen at

I will release this application soon for download as a reference of how to use some of the functions.
